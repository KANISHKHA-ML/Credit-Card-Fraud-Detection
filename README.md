# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset is from Kaggle and contains 284,807 transactions, with 492 labeled as fraudulent.

## Fraud Detection
Fraud detection involves identifying illegal transactions or activities within financial systems. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and anomalies in transaction data to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities. By training models on historical transaction data, these algorithms learn to recognize suspicious behavior and flag potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time, helping financial institutions minimize losses and protect customers.

## Installation
Install the required libraries using:
- pandas
